## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Abdelrahman, and I'm an ASU trained Computer Scientist student interested in all coding-related work.
- ðŸŒ± I recently built a website for selling books and trips with an interactive dashboard for managing products and creating complex, useful reports for end users.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with sharing my software products to as many people as possible to gain feedback, improve and add new features maybe :)
